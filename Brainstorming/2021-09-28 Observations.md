A scout set of legs will have a hard time breaking out of it's class for more than 1 piece. Either a head or 1 arm.

A light set if legs currently JUST misses being able to equip 3 pieces of med and 1 scout.
A light set of legs will never support a heavy core.
A light set of legs can support a scout core, light arm, med arm, and light head.
(slight boost to light stability?)

A medium set of legs should be able to hand a heavy left arm, if it has a light core and a light head, it may be able to hand a shoulder weapon, power permitting.
