Work on the javascript based mecha shop interface is well under way.
Implementing all of the obvious choices is more or less finished, and brainstorming the properties and relationships of mecha parts to stats is now needed.

### Part Types
- Head
- Core
- Arms
- Legs
- Shoulders (currently labelled misc)
- Not yet implemented:
	- Additional Boosters?
	- Shields?
	- Slotted upgrades like rings, runes, etc?
	- Drones

### Manufacturers

Additionally, characterizations and tentative names for the mecha parts manufacturers is also needed. Look to Borderlands for inspiration on how many / how specialized they are.

```
Borderlands uses Nine (9) Standard Manufacturers
- Above-average balanced attributes.
- Highest magazine-capacity; below-average balanced attributes.
- Highest accuracy and recoil reduction, burst-fire when aiming.
- Highest accuracy, damage and recoil reduction, above-average alanced attributes; high tech, expensive.
- Highest damage and accuracy, hidden critical-hit bonus, lever-action/semi-automatic weapons-only; heavy recoil, no automatic or elemental weapons, expensive.
- Highest elemental effect-chance, elemental weapons-only; high tech, expensive.
- Highest magazine capacity; high tech, expensive.
- Fastest reload speed, cheapest price-tags; below-average balanced attributes (when reloading, gun is thrown like a grenade).
- Highest damage, explosive ammunition; decreased accuracy and heavy recoil.
- Highest rate of fire and recoil reduction, automatic weapons-only (as the trigger is held, rate of fire and recoil reduction increases); no semi-automatic weapons.
```

			- Folded 1000 times, melee specialty beam sabers
- SciFi Latin / Greek Overwrought name
			- [[Mantissa]]

### Set Bonuses
...are for nerds. But random rolled loot should produce a nice wide variety of playstyles and stats.
