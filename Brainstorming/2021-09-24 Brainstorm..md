	Today I want to get a rough calculation of how many mecha parts would be produced by the current loot algorithm, to see if the game is more like Diablo 2, Borderlands, or Dark Souls. Mainly I'm trying to decide if random rolled stats make for good gameplay. Ultimately it comes down to PvE and PvP - a balanced PvP game should have predicable parts, a Shooter Looter game should have variety and perfectable endgame loot.

DARK SOULS
Dark Souls games gets their armor variety from having 56 - 87 sets of Armor, each with 4 pieces, (plus a few unique head armors). Total Pieces ~ 224 - 348.
Total Weapons: 222
Total Shields: 50ish
Rings, Spells... another 200?
700+ uniques

BORDERLANDS
Borderlands gets their weapon variety from having 9 main manufactuers making 6 different types of guns at 3-5 permuations. That makes 270 base guns that are then made infinitely unique with different stats. 

DIABLO 2
13 weapon types x 4-10 sub types ~ 100ish base types
6 armor slots x 8-15 sub types ~ 75ish base types
175 base parts at 4 rarity levels = 700 base parts that are then made infinitely unique with different stats.

MS GUNDAM BATTLE OPERATION 2
145ish mobile suits. Lots of duplication of parts? Gatcha game.
