Looking at heading off stat imbalances today.

It can be hard to balance slow&strong with fast&weak builds.
Currently the SuperHeavy class seems to be the best rated class - but this may just be due to the way that a set's score is calculated (favoring Armor over Speed, and Damage over Thrust). The most armored mech has 50% again the AC, and 30% again the damage of even a 5 Star Scout class.

If I make the penalties of slow movement too taxing (for example slowing the turn radius), it could still be that the light and scout classes are the big winners. I think I have enough stats to begin making the game. So I'll model a set at each weight and simply color them differently for the different manufacturers and begin testing.
