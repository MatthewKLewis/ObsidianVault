The only decent names for [[Mecha]] A.K.A. giant military robots:
- Mobile Suit /  Doll / Fighter - Gundam Franchise
- Armored Core - FROM's video game series
- Labor - Patlabor Movies
- EVA - Evangelion
- Metal Gear

The worst trope in mecha is using some overwrought german / greek / latin term for your machines like Kataphrakt or Panzer.

Sum of "Cool Adjective" + "Machine Synecdoche" seems best.

Grid Pawn
Grid Knight

What is it I really like in fiction?
```
He never turned his face to 
mine,  or  answered,  except  in  monosyllables,  the  questions  I  put,  or 
such slight pleasantries as I ventured. He seemed a part of the mute 
melancholy landscape, an incarnation of its frozen woe, with all that 
was warm and sentient in him fast bound below the surface; but there 
was nothing unfriendly in his silence. I simply felt that he lived in a 
depth of moral isolation too remote for casual access,  and I had the 
sense  that  his  loneliness  was  not  merely  the  result  of  his  personal 
plight, tragic as I guessed that to be, but had in it, as Harmon Gow had 
hinted, the profound accumulated cold of many Starkfield winters.

-  A bleakness, a sense that all the characters have to reach out through a dense mist towards each other's subjectivity. And the persistence of doubt of the other.
- Uncertainty, a Godot to wait for? or plot elements that come from or return to nowhere.
- What else?
