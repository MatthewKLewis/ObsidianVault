The only decent names for [[Mecha]] A.K.A. giant military robots:
- Mobile Suit /  Doll / Fighter - Gundam Franchise
- Armored Core - FROM's video game series
- Labor - Patlabor Movies
- EVA - Evangelion
- Metal Gear

The worst trope in mecha is using some overwrought german / greek / latin term for your machines like Kataphrakt or Panzer.

Sum of "Cool Adjective" + "Machine Synecdoche" seems best.
