# Stats Principles

Mechs have a power production rating, determined by the quality of the core. They also have a power consumption rate, determined by the other parts of the mech. A mech will not function if power consumption exceeds production. Excess power production can be used in the field to perform certain special maneuvers.

Mecha weight and balance determine the speed and manueverability of the machine. A ratio of "top weight" (the weight of the core, head, shoulders, arms and weapons) against the leg weight is a useful ratio to be aware of, but gear heads will want to pay close attention to leg and booster power to get the optimal balance of agility and shielding.

Rough "Armor Ratings" and "Thermal Resistance Ratings" are assigned to every mecha part. These approximate the tendency for a part to stand up to ballistic and energy weapon fire.

Similarly, weapons have "Attack Ratings" which roughly demonstrate the kinetic or thermal power of the weapon.
