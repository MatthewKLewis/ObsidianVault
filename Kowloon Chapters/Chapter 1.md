Harry felt the first tingle of insect legs skittering across the sweaty skin of his palms. He was going to start to detox soon if he didn't get a dose. The prescription digitablet was in the familiar place by his bed, in a neat stack on top of his medical bag, under his wallet and eyeglasses case, with keyring draped smartly over the top. Harry chuckled at the fact that he always seemed to have the presence of mind to keep to his habits even when methadrenol, throbbing through his blood-brain barrier, prevented the formation of long term memory. He knew if he was hurting for a dose this bad already he must have slept through Saturday, and a quick glance at his watch confirmed that he had lost 36 hours.

Harry put on his long coat and hat and pulled the collar up. Outside as he walked the narrow street between tenement buildings the air blew alternatively hot and thick, cold and dry, and with any imaginable smell or combination of smells as he ducked under air conditioners, darted past exhaust fans, and passed chinese restaurants and designated 'sanitation' alleys. Rusting fire escapes obscured the sky above, if it was still there, and the lights of a thousand high up tv sets and grow operations formed a new urban starscape.

Striding out onto Selenita Boulevard, Harry made an adjustment to his life-support systems - removing the handkerchief from under his nose, dropping the high collar of his jacket, but donning a set of prescription sunglasses and cheap foam earplugs. Lao Kuan was a harsh place to live but for the most part it assaulted your senses only one or two at a time. Harry made a fist to crush an ant or two and strode intently the three blocks to Curare Convenience.

Harry pushed past a trio of Indonesian teenagers arguing with a security robot over the price of orange soda and made his way to the back of the shop. Shonda, the late shift pharmacology assistant met his eye as he turned down the aisle and flashed an exagerrated frown.

"Sorry, baby, we shut."
"Shut down? Closed?",  Harry replied.
"We're getting audited. They say we give out too many pills for what the government say the population is here."
"My patients..." Harry paused. He didn't need to lie to Shonda but it was best to keep up appearances in case there was a health department stooge hidden just out of view of the pharmacy window. "Will be very disappointed. Okay. Sorry. Goodbye. Wait, how long?"
"Prolly a week."

Almost immediately the termite colony started to emerge from Harry's wrists and ankles. The placebo of clinical grade junkie anticipation had worn off. Harry slogged back out of the pharmacy and threw his back against the wet vinyl exterior wall. Drips from a high up air conditioner slapped against his balding scalp and a few beetles emerged to slurp up the moisture. He crossed his arms and legs at the wrists and ankles and rubbed vigourously to think. The club. Harry will go to the club.

The 'nightlife' at Club Bouk Bouk didn't get too crowded until at least 12pm, and Harry thanked god he wouldn't have to scream his beggar's plea over the sounds of a Singaporean rap group to Guan, the assistant manager. Harry walked past Troy, one of the clubs bouncers and turned town the alley. Behind the club a teenager had loaded a retro DJ's turntable onto a hand cart and was attempting to ram the clearly too wide load through a clearly too narrow door. Harry watched in amazement for ten long seconds before offering to help him through.

"TY, old"
"You're welcome"

The bugs relented temporarily in honor of man's sacred duty to lift heavy furniture.  Harry felt over the surface of the audio board for loose parts, snatching up a removable tone arm and a cheapo guitar pedal and dropping them into his large coat pockets, before deftly levering the whole cabinet onto its side and walking backwards through the door, past the kitchen, and out into the open dance floor. 

"I see you've met my nephew."

Guan was sitting at the bar with a bowl of pistachios. Harry nodded to the kid and they placed the turntables on the edge of the stage.

"Oh, yes. Anyways nice to meet you..." Harry pivoted and stretched out a sweaty palm. The kid walked boldly to within a foot of Harry and darted his hand into Harry's coat pocket, retreiving the lost tone arm and pedal.
"Longwei. You too, old."
"My office." Guan said.

Harry and Guan went behind the bar and ascended a thin spiral staircase to a single room on the second level. Guan went behind his desk and peered out of a small window down at the dance floor. Harry stood behind a painful looking metal folding chair in front of the desk.

"You planned this well didn't you? You are here to ask me for something so you make a big show of doing a favor for my kin." Guan laughed. "I'll level with you, Harry, I have half a dose of some off-brand shit... unless you want to wait around for the party to start - then you can go down on the dance floor and ask around." He laughed again, not bothering to wait for Harry's response. "You can take half of half now and half of half later but I need a favor in return."
"What is it?"
A flash of anger splashed across Guans face and he wrestled it into a polite grin. "I'm not in the habit of explaining the favor before securing the promise that it will be done -  but for gweilo... It's simple. I need a package from a storehouse on Zhixin and Bo. I'll call them and tell them you're coming." 
"Can't we just do the standing deal? I havent given your working girls a check up in a few weeks."
"Harry, this is a much easier task." Guan's face was inscrutable during negotiations.
"Ok. Fine."

Guan tapped the telecombit in his ear and gazed out the window. In the pre-rave silence Harry could hear the dialtone from Guan's earpiece. It rang several times and Guan ended the call before the voicemail kicked in.

"Just go ahead Harry. Zixin and Bo streets, the southwest corner, 6th floor. I'll keep calling. And here." Guan opened a drawer in his desk and pulled out a small vial - half filled with tan liquid. 

"I'll fix here and quick if you don't mind then head out."

Harry went down the stairs and almost broke into a jog across the dance floor as he headed for the bathroom. In a stall he produced a syringe and rubber hose and half filled his half dose. He prayed that this stuff was at least somewhat chemically similar to methadrenol. The opaque color indicated that it was probably made by some small time cooks here in Lao Kuan and cut with rice starch and water. He had shot up worse. No flushing, and barely a bead of blood at the injection site. At least his medical degree was getting some use.

Out on the street the crowd waved like golden reeds in the marsh sunset of shop window and street light. Harry's head bobbed above the amber waves and his feet, far below him in the muddy depths, kicked and fluttered and carried him along. At the far end of Selenita he left Little Mexico City, and turned onto Zixin street where the tones of the crowd chatter abruptly shifted as it accomodated Cantonese vowels. Three more blocks floated by til he ran aground at the intersection with Bo. He recognized the uniform of a Bouk Bouk bouncer on a man smoking a cigarette.

"I'm here from Guan. 6th Floor?"
The bouncer, a Maori or Samoan behemoth of a man raised a masthead of an arm north along Bo street and pointed a finger left, "First turn down the alley there. I had better come with."

In the alley two of Guan's men in Triad bombers were coming down a fire escape. Seeing Harry, they zipped up their uniforms tight and stuffed their hands in their front pockets. The unmistakable printing of the silhouettes of small caliber weapons glinted, one each, on the taut surface of the bomber jackets.
