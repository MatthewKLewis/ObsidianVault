Story Beats:

Harry, trying to avoid detox, approaches club owner and Triad leader Guan for a fix. Guan sends him on an errand to 'deliver a parcel for him'.
	
	The Trojans, ready to attack the Greek camp, see smoke coming from the Greek camp and cautiously approach.
	
When Harry arrives at the appointed location, the Triads have already attacked another, older, more traditional gang called Golden Society. They broke into a warehouse owned by the enemy group and kidnap a young man. Harry's task is to use his credentials as a doctor to move the 'injured patient' to a Triad safehouse.

	The Trojans circle him and gently ask him questions but when he does not answer they grow angry and begin to threaten to stab him. When he still does not answer, the Trojans cut off his ears and nose. Finally he tells them that the Greeks have fled and they built the Trojan Horse to honor Athena.
	
The Triads torture the young man into revealing the location of a gold reserve which is owned by a big corporation which has partnered with the older gang. Guan doesn't want to make an enemy of a multi-national and advices against robbing them. But suddenly, in a seemingly unrelated event, his nephew is killed and he is blinded in one eye in a  shooting in his club. The shooter is a jilted lover of one of the club 'hostesses' who has a relationship with Guan.

	Laocoön begged the Trojans to set fire to the Trojan horse to ensure it was not a trick.
	
With Guan, the one naysayer, in the hospital the Triads decide to rob the corporation. When the Triads rob the corporate safehouse, they discover the corporation is actually growing a genetically modified human with the features of Buddha. The Triads capture the genemodded man and take it to the safehouse as well.

	The enraged Laocoön threw his spear at the Horse in response.
	
Guan gets out of the hospital and attempts to kill the bioweapon, which kills him with some buddhist thing? Harry burns the safehouse down and escapes but sees the Buddha emerge.
