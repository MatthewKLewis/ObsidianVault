# I.

4:30pm. The phone rang. Harry put down his laptop bag and answered.
  
"Hey Harry, its Deborah." 
"Hey Deborah."  
"So I just got a call from Ad Sales. The VP over there - Denton Jupyter. Hes in a panic about a client. Apparently they guaranteed, like contractually guaranteed, that their new ad campaign would take the #1 spot in Trendlines."  
"This is an unencrypted line, Deborah." Harry paused. "Did they buy enough promotion to get to number one?"  
"Apparently it was the biggest purchase ever, so if anything is beating it in the trendlines, the neural network must be registering it as an earthquake or something. But Denton says the *client* says that it looks like a viral ad. Can you check it out? The hashtag is 'precursor' or anything related to it. And don't worry about sorting out the trendlines - I'll get Derrick to put in a manual fix."  
  
The call was embarrassing for Harry. He hated having his own algorithm explained to him and he hated even more having to manually adjust the success of an advertisement. Harry pulled his laptop back out of the bag, opened it, logged in, and started his backend dashboard and an internet browser. Sure enough, the top trendline was "WHO IS THE PRECURSOR?". There was a massive spike of traffic with this term starting at 11:00 pm GMT.

Harry had led Machine Learning at Meemo for just a few months. When he took over, he emphasized to his team the importance of capturing what he dubbed the "authentic trend". Before his arrival, data scientists often caved to pressure from the Sales department to fudge trending stories. Harry had come up with the idea to count paid promoted messages as authentic traffic, that way Sales only had to convince ad buyers to buy enough traffic that the algorithm would pick up their content and re-promote it in the trendlines as real engagement. It was one last deal with the devil so that they never had to astroturf again. Harry had personally vouched to Denton Jupyter that the only topic that could supplant a massive ad campaign was a natural disaster or American presidential election. "Nothing else has the data signature to override a huge ad buy" He had said.

Harry clicked the hashtag and took a look at some messages. 

	Who / What is the Precursor? Is anyone else wondering about this?!
	Was this a dream I had? 'The Precursor' #Precursor?
	Looks like Meemo got hacked! Precursor isn't a movie or video game AFAIK. Probably Russian/Chinese Trolls

Harry sent an encrypted intranet chat to Will, his friend in Security.

	No big hacks today right?
	Uh oh lol. No, why?
	I didn't think so sorry. Just some weird traffic.
	Kids these days

Will was right. The algorithm had also assigned a demographic tag to the messages: "Age group: 13-24". Harry wrote a note on his whiteboard: "Strong demographic confidence should CORRELATE AGAINST natural disaster confidence." Whatever this precursor thing was, it trended like a natural disaster - the messages were mostly questions, Russia and or China was at fault, there was heavy use of question marks *with* exclamation marks, and the traffic graphed as a sharp spike. But 'Precursor' was not specific to a location, and highly specific to youths. Across the world, tens of millions of young people were posting about 'Precursor' at the same time.
